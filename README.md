<h2>My first custom theme for the Brackets Editor</h2>

<h2>Installing Theme</h2>

Downloading the file should be occuring.

Refer to [Guide to Brackets Extension](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions) for a detailed guide to installing addons or themes into Brackets.


<h2>Resources</h2>
Here are a couple resources I found that are very useful when I was creating my first custom theme.

[Creating Themes] (https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Creating-Themes) - **Start here first.**
 
[Extension package format] (https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Extension-package-format#packagejson-format) - Detail information about .json

[Dark Theme] (https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/src/extensions/default/DarkTheme/main.less) - Basic Theme to start out with and edit. The theme was provided by Adobe Corporation.

Brackets themes are written in [Less](http://lesscss.org/) or [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) format since version 1.1.


<h2>Documentation Guide</h2>
GitHub has their own markup syntax for styling Markdown documents like the ReadMe.md file. Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform. 

Here is a link to [Mastering Markdown in GitHub] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). I found it very helpful.
