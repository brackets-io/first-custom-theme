<h2>My first custom theme for Brackets</h2>

***Work In Progress***

This is my first custom theme for the Brackets editor. I am a new student to web development and github. So please bare with me as I learn to setup this project.


<h2>Resources</h2>
Here are a couple resources I found that are very useful when I was creating my first custom theme.

[Creating Themes] (https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Creating-Themes) - **Start here first.**
 
[Extension package format] (https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Extension-package-format#packagejson-format) - Detail information about .json

[Dark Theme] (https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/src/extensions/default/DarkTheme/main.less) - Basic Theme to start out with and edit. The theme was provided by Adobe Corporation.

Brackets themes are written in [Less](http://lesscss.org/) or [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) format since version 1.1.


<h2>Style A ReadMe.md File</h2>
GitHub has their own markup syntax for styling documents like a ReadMe file. Here is the link to [Writing in GitHub] (https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). I found it very helpful.
