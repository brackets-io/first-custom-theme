##My first custom theme for the Brackets Editor

This is my first custom theme for the Brackets editor. I am a new student to web development and github.


##Installing Theme
Install custom theme directly through the Brackets program. Look for the file named **Rolando Zabala II's Dark Theme** under the *Themes Tab* inside the *Extension Manager*.

Or

Click on
![download-zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolo298github/first-custom-theme/master/screenshots/download_zip.PNG)

You will be downloading the .zip file from my github account directly to install into Brackets.

For addition help refer to [Guide to Brackets Extension](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions) for a detailed guide to installing addons or themes into Brackets.


##Resources
Here are a couple resources I found that are very useful when I was creating my first custom theme.

[Creating Themes] (https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Creating-Themes) - **Start here first.**
 
[Extension package format] (https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Extension-package-format#packagejson-format) - Detail information about .json

[Dark Theme] (https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/src/extensions/default/DarkTheme/main.less) - Basic Theme to start out with and edit. The theme was provided by Adobe Corporation.

Brackets themes are written in [Less](http://lesscss.org/) or [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) format since version 1.1.


##Documentation Guide
GitHub has their own markup syntax for styling Markdown documents like the ReadMe.md file. Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform. 

Here is a link to [Mastering Markdown in GitHub] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). I found it very helpful.
