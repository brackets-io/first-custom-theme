My first custom theme for Brackets

This is my first custom theme for the Brackets editor. I am still working on this project and it is a work in progress. I am a new student to web development and github. So please bare with me as I learn to setup this project up.

Here is a couple resources I found very useful when I was creating my first custome theme.
